		<h4>A microcurrent facial is often referred to as a “natural” facelift. This safe and painless facial helps ease fine lines and wrinkles, while firming your skin and defining your features. It improves muscle tone, reduces puffiness, increases cellular activity, and tightens pores.  Microcurrent is ideal for all skin types.</h4><br>

		<img src="ultrasonicExfoliation.png"  alt= "A client receiving ultrasonic exfoliation">
		<div class="productDetails">
		<h4>With ultrasonic exfoliation, a water solution is applied to the skin to loosen surface dead skin cells and a guided spatula activated by ultrasonic soundwaves (28,000 vibrations per second) lifts the dry skin cells off the skin. While doing this, the water solution is also being infused deep into the skin allow the “new” skin cells to get hydrated. Ultrasonic exfoliation also helps to unblock clogged pores so painful extractions are not necessary.</h4><br>

		<img src="hiFrequency.jpg"  alt= "A client receiving high frequency therapy for problem acne.">
		<div class="productDetails">
		<h4>High Frequency is a popular skincare technique that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including acne management, enlarged pores, fine lines and wrinkles and puffy or dark eyes. An ultra-thin sheet of qauze is place over the face in high frequency therapy. A mild electrical current passes through the neon, or argon gas filled glass electrode, causing it to emit a subtle glow and buzzing noise. This therapy slows acne by destroying bacteria on the surface of the skin  </h4><br>

		<img src="coldStoneTherapy.jpg"  alt= "A client receiving cold stone therapy to end a facial treatment.">
		<div class="productDetails">
		<h4>Every facial finishes with a cold jade stone massage.  The esthetician glides the cold stone over the client's face in gentle upward sweeps.  The Cold Jade Stone massage stimulates lymphatic drainage and reduces puffiness under the eyes and gives the skin a nice lift.  This therapy is both very relaxing for the client and helps to calm sensitive skin. </h4><br>
